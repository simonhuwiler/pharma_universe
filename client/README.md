This is the repository for [this story](https://journalist.sh/pharmauniverse/).

## What's behind it?
Pharmaceutical companies pay money to doctors and organizations every year. We collect this data on the [pharmagelder.ch](https://www.pharmagelder.ch) platform. This data visualization uses this data and creates a universe based on it. At the edges of the universe, there are the pharmaceutical companies (planets). The money recipients are asteroids. Each more money an asteroid has received from a pharmaceutical company, the closer it is to the corresponding planet. Asteroids that have received money from only one company are placed in the orbit of the planet. The size of the planet and the asteroid depends on the amount of money paid or received.

## Licensing
You may use this at your wish with one restriction: The mesh of the lava planet (Novartis) is not free. You need to buy it as well. You will [find it here](https://www.cgtrader.com/3d-models/textures/natural/lava-pbr-seamless-texture).
